    %The document class defines the master templates, the structure of the document, 
    %and lays out the types of 
    %objects that can be manipulated for this type of document. 
    %the brackets contain basic options that will be applied globally (throughout
    %the document). Here, we specify a 10pt font, and when we number an equation, the 
    %number will be on the left.
    %The document class is a file ***.cls. You will probably never have to edit or create
    % a .cls file. There are many available on the internet for your use.

\begin{problem} Let $P$ be a set of people, $U$ a set of umbrellas, and $D$ the set of days of the year.  A day can be either good or bad.  Define $f:P \to U$ such that $f(p) =u$ means person $p$ owns umbrella $u$ (each person owns exactly one umbrella).  Write the following statement using symbols in $\{\forall,\exists,\implies\}$
\begin{center}
“If two people own the same umbrella, then all days are bad.”
\end{center}
Hint: Express “two people own the same umbrella” and “all days are bad”separately, then combine them.

\begin{problem} We have seen in class and recitation, that the power set of a set $S$ has cardinality $2^{|S|}$ (assuming $S$ is finite).  Let $A$ and $B$ be two finite sets.  Is it possible that $|\mathcal{P}(A \times B)|=|\mathcal{P}(A)|\cdot|\mathcal{P}(B)|$?  If Yes, give an example, if No say why.
\\\\
\Large
This is not possible.  Consider two sets $A$ and $B$, where $|A| = n$, and $|B| = m$.  Then $|\mathcal{P}(A \times B)| = 2^{nm}$ and $|\mathcal{P}(A)| \cdot |\mathcal{P}(B)| = 2^{n+m}$.  However, $nm = n+m$ has no solution, therefore it is not possible that $|\mathcal{P}(A \times B)|=|\mathcal{P}(A)|\cdot|\mathcal{P}(B)|$.

\begin{problem} You are on a trip and you find 3 kinds of postcards $K=\{A, B, C\}$.  You have 12 friends.  You want to send postcards to your friends while observing the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each friend must receive at least one postcard\\
\item No friend can receive two or more postcards of the same kind
\end{itemize}
In how many ways can you send the postcards?  Hint:  Think about the powerset of $K$ to figure out the possibilities for each friend, then use the product rule.
\Large
\\\\
Each friend can receive up to 3 postcards and there are 12 of them, so we have $3^{12} = 531441$
