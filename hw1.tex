Consider  a  regular  8×8  chessboard.   The  chessboard  is  to  be  used  to  play snakes and ladders, but there is an extra condition on how to place snakes on the chessboard:  The head and tail of a snake must occupy squares of different color.  Ladders remain unconstrained.  In how many ways can we:
\begin{enumerate}[label=()a)]
\item Place one snake.
\item Place two snakes.
\item Place a ladder and a snake.  (Hint:  think about the snake first to make the phases independent.)
\end{enumerate}
In answering the questions above,  reason using the product rule as we did in class, and explicitly describe the different phases and determine in how many ways each phase can be carried out.  In addition,  justify any adjustment you make due to possible over-counting.
