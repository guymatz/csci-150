\begin{problem} An odd number is an integer that can be written as $2k + 1$ where $k \in Z$.  Is -1 an odd number?
\\\\
\Large
With $k=-1$, -1 can be written as $2k + 1$: $2(-1) + 1 = -1$.  So, yes, -1 is an odd number.

\begin{problem} What is the contrapositive of “If it is raining, then I have my umbrella”.

If it is not raining, then I do not have my umbrella.

\begin{problem} Is the following True or False?
$$ \forall x, y \in  \mathbb{Z}.(x > y) \implies (x^2 > y^2)$$
\Large
False!!  Counter-example: x=-1, y=-2
\\\\
To make the statement true, it could read:
$$ \forall x, y \in  \mathbb{N}.(x > y) \implies (x^2 > y^2)$$
\end{problem}
\newpage

\begin{problem} Show that there exist two irrational numbers $x, y$ such that $xy$ is rational.
\\\\
\Large
Let $x,y \in \mathbb{P}$, and $x = y^{-1}$.  Then $xy = 1$, and 1 is rational
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} It is a  fact that if $n^2$ is a multiple of 3, then n is
a multiple of 3. Use this fact to show by contradiction that $\sqrt{3}$  is irrational.

\begin{problem} Prove by contradiction that $17n + 2$ is odd $\implies n$ is odd.

$$A - B^C = A \cap B$$

\begin{problem} Given a set $S \subset \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, .\dots \}$ Show that
$$ |P(S)| =  \sum_{i \in S}^{}i \implies |S| \text{ is even}$$
Hint:  The sum of elements in $S$ can be written as $2k+|S|$.
\\\\

\newpage


\begin{problem} Show using the contrapositive that
\begin{center}
$n^2$ is a multiple of 3 $\implies n$ is a multiple of 3
\end{center}
\\
Hint:  Any number $n$ can be written as either $3k$,  $3k+ 1$,  or $3k+ 2$ for some integer $k$ (in the last two cases $n$ is not a multiple of 3).
\Large

\begin{problem} What is $(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}})$?  Use your finding to show that there exist two irrational numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $x^y$ is rational.
